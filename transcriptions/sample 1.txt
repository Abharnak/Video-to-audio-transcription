 I learned my English by myself when I was a child. I never got one day English training class, all-side China. But I think I understand the Western culture much more better than those Chinese students study outside. Because I'm not learning language, I'm learning culture. Where you respect the other culture. Where you appreciate the other culture. It's easy to make friends. If you don't like the other culture, you will never make friends. If you don't have friends, how can you do business? So I would say language helped me a lot. But most things helped me is my respect for the different culture.
