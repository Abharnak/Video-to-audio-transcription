 Ups and downs you always have in life. You will have more of it, don't worry. But the fact that you recognize it and the fact that you recognize that that really drains you down is enough for you to know that you will overcome it. You have to motivate yourself. You have to motivate yourself because what comes from within is the one which stays with you. I can tell you 10 things and go away today. But unless you self motivate, saying, hey, come on. Yes, ups and downs. Yes, today was a bad day. But I will see you tomorrow better.
